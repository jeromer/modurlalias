How does this module work ?
===========================

The behaviour of this module is really simple.
Whenever an URI is asked for your website it will
look for the corresponding controller supposed
the handle the request.

For example a visitor requests the following URL :

http://[...]/]David-Carradine-suicide-theory-disputed

And this content must be handled by the article/read.php file.

Then the mod_url_alias will finally call article/read.php with
the corresponding parameters the read the article and returns
its contents.

You are not forced to use PHP here if you are a Python, Perl or
Ruby developer it will work the same way since the module only
does an internal redirection to a specific file. You are not forced
to use a specific language. You can even use multiple languages to
handle different URIs.

So basically this means that you will get 1 SQL query per requested URL.
This should not be a performance issue since the executed SQL query is really
simple and use an index.
